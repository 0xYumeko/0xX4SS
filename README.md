Summary of the 0xX4SS Script
Purpose: The script is designed to test a target domain for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities by injecting various payloads into URLs.

Vulnerability Testing:

For each gathered URL, the script injects each payload and checks the response for any script execution (looking for a specific alert in the response).
If a vulnerability is found, it logs the vulnerable URL with the injected payload in the terminal.
